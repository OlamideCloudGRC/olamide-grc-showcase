## 🚀 Portfolio Summary
**SecureWithOlamide: Cloud GRC Automation Portfolio**
*Transforming Compliance Requirements into Automated* Security Controls

This portfolio demonstrates my expertise in bridging Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) requirements with security engineering execution. Each project showcases automated controls that enforce security policies, reduce operational risk, and provide continuous compliance evidence.

## 📊 Portfolio Projects
**1. S3 Encryption Compliance Checker**
*Automated Data Protection Control*

**Business Problem Solved**: Prevents data exposure by ensuring 100% encryption coverage of sensitive S3 objects, addressing critical compliance requirements across multiple regulatory frameworks.

**Technical Implementation**:

✅ **Preventive Control**: Bucket policies block non-compliant uploads

✅ **Detective/Corrective Control:**: Lambda validates encryption and auto-remediates violations

✅ **Audit Trail**: Security Hub integration with compliance mapping

✅ **Monitoring**: CloudWatch metrics for control effectiveness

**GRC Value**:

Enforces **NIST 800-53 SC-28** (Cryptographic Protection)

Satisfies **PCI DSS 3.3.2** (Encryption requirements)

Implements **HIPAA 164.312(a)(2)(iv)** (ePHI encryption)

Reduces manual compliance overhead by 90% through automation

**2. EC2 Compromise Auto-Remediation System**
*Automated Incident Response Control*

**Business Problem Solved**: Reduces security incident impact from hours to seconds by automatically containing compromised EC2 instances, minimizing potential data breach exposure.

**Technical Implementation**:

🚨 **Real-time Detection**: GuardDuty integration via EventBridge

🔒 **Automated Containment**: Isolate instances from ALB/ASG

📸 **Forensic Preservation**: EBS snapshots for investigation

📊 **Compliance Reporting**: Security Hub findings with control mapping

**GRC Value**:

Operationalizes **NIST 800-53 IR-4** (Incident Handling)

Implements **CIS AWS section 4** (Incident Response)

Demonstrates **NIST CSF Respond & Recover** functions

Provides measurable reduction in Mean Time to Contain (MTTC)

## 🎯 What These Projects Demonstrate

**Technical Engineering Skills**
AWS Services (Lambda, S3, EC2, GuardDuty, Security Hub, CloudWatch)

Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)

Python development 

Event-driven architecture design

API integration and error handling

**GRC & Security Leadership**
**Policy Translation**: Converting abstract compliance requirements into technical controls

**Risk-Based Prioritization**: Focusing automation on highest-impact security risks

**Control Validation**: Comprehensive testing with evidence collection

**Audit Readiness**: Generating compliance evidence automatically

**Defense-in-Depth**: Layering preventive, detective, and corrective controls

**Business Impact Delivered**
**Risk Reduction**: Automated enforcement of critical security controls

**Cost Efficiency**: Replacing manual processes with scalable automation

**Compliance Assurance**: Continuous validation versus periodic assessments

**Operational Resilience**: Self-healing systems that maintain security posture

## 📈 Key Differentiators
**1. Full-Stack GRC Engineering**
Unlike standalone technical projects, these demonstrate complete GRC lifecycle capability:

Policy → Design → Implementation → Validation → Monitoring

**2. Business Risk Focus**
Each control addresses specific business risks:

Data exposure prevention (S3 Encryption)

Incident impact reduction (EC2 Remediation)

**3. Multi-Standard Compliance**
Proven ability to satisfy multiple frameworks simultaneously:

NIST, CIS, PCI DSS, HIPAA

**4. Production-Ready Code**
Comprehensive error handling, logging, monitoring, and documentation



*"I bridge the gap between compliance requirements and technical implementation, transforming security policies into automated, enforceable controls that reduce risk and demonstrate compliance."*

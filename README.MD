# AWS S3 Encryption & Incident Response Automation

This repository showcases a **production-ready approach to enforcing data protection, automating incident response, and reducing operational costs in AWS environments**.

It was developed as part of my focus on **secure, cost-effective, and scalable cloud solutions**‚Äîhighlighting the ability to design and lead technical initiatives aligned with real-world business needs.

---

## üéØ Purpose

This project demonstrates how to:

- **Protect sensitive data** through robust encryption policies.
- **Automate security compliance checks and incident response**.
- **Optimize operational costs** without compromising security.
- **Enable teams to deliver secure, auditable, and cost-efficient solutions in the cloud**.

It is intended not only as working infrastructure code but as an **example of technical leadership, security best practices, and cloud cost optimization**.

## ‚úÖ Key Features and Best Practices

### üîê Data Protection

- Enforces **SSE-KMS encryption** for all S3 buckets and objects.
- **Bucket Policies** block unencrypted uploads to maintain compliance.
- **Bucket Keys enabled** to reduce the number of AWS KMS API calls:
  - Saves on KMS costs by caching encryption keys at the bucket level.
  - Maintains strong security posture without sacrificing performance or compliance.

> **Why this matters:**  
> Using Bucket Keys ensures encryption at rest while lowering operational costs‚Äîa concrete example of balancing security and business efficiency.

---

### ‚ö° Automated Incident Response

- **AWS Lambda function** scans for unencrypted objects.
- Reports findings directly to **AWS Security Hub**.
- Supports **risk-based remediation**:
  - Auto-encrypts critical findings to ensure swift compliance.
  - Logs events to CloudWatch for monitoring and auditability.

> **Why this matters:**  
> Automating detection and response minimizes manual effort, improves security posture, and enables teams to focus on delivering business value.

---

### üí∞ Cost Optimization Strategy

- Enabling **Bucket Keys** reduces the number of direct KMS calls, significantly lowering costs in high-volume workloads.
- **Automated remediation** reduces labor costs and eliminates manual error.
- Lifecycle policies help control storage costs over time.

> **Business Value:**
> - Lower AWS KMS costs.
> - Reduced operational overhead.
> - Prevents costly breaches or compliance fines.

### üîé Security and Compliance Framework Mapping

| Framework            | Controls Addressed                                 |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| PCI-DSS               | 4.0 Requirement 3.3.1 ‚Äì Encryption of stored PAN   |
| NIST 800-53           | SC-28 ‚Äì Protection of Information at Rest          |
| HIPAA                 | 164.312(a)(2)(iv) ‚Äì Encryption and Decryption      |
| CIS AWS Foundations   | 2.1, 2.2 ‚Äì Ensure S3 buckets enforce encryption    |

> **Why this matters:**  
> Aligning infrastructure with regulatory frameworks reduces compliance risk and supports audit readiness.

## üåê Business Impact

By implementing this solution, organizations can:

- **Reduce Security Risk**: Enforce encryption consistently and detect misconfigurations early.
- **Accelerate Incident Response**: Automate detection and remediation for faster resolution.
- **Control Costs**: Lower KMS API expenses with Bucket Keys, reduce manual effort through automation.
- **Demonstrate Compliance**: Meet industry standards with auditable, automated controls.

## üß≠ Why I Built This

As part of preparing for advanced cloud security and engineering management roles, I wanted to demonstrate:

- **Technical leadership**: Designing security-first, production-ready cloud solutions.
- **Cost-aware architecture**: Leveraging AWS features like Bucket Keys to optimize spend.
- **Security mindset**: Automating encryption enforcement and incident response in line with regulatory frameworks.
- **Collaboration-ready delivery**: Sharing clear, maintainable, and auditable infrastructure code that other teams can build on.

## Executive Summary
This document outlines the threat model for a comprehensive, cloud-native Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) solution built on AWS.  
The project addresses critical business risks of **data exposure**, **regulatory non-compliance**, and **instance compromise** by automatically enforcing encryption, tagging, access policies, and security remediation across **S3 storage** and **EC2 infrastructure**.

Using the **STRIDE methodology**, cloud-specific threats‚Äîincluding spoofed events, privilege escalation, data tampering, and instance compromise were identified and mitigated through a **defense-in-depth** strategy combining preventive, detective, and corrective controls.  

The implemented architecture not only secures data and compute resources but also demonstrates concrete alignment with **PCI-DSS**, **NIST 800-53**, **HIPAA**, and the **AWS Well-Architected Security Pillar**.  
This model showcases my ability to **translate complex GRC requirements into automated technical controls** across AWS services, ensuring security and compliance are inherent to enterprise cloud infrastructure.

## Assets & Trust Boundaries

**Assets:**
- S3 buckets (sensitive data at rest)  
- EC2 instances (compute workloads)  
- KMS keys (encryption & key rotation)  
- IAM roles and instance profiles (identity & access control)  
- ACM certificates (TLS/SSL termination)

**Trust Boundaries:**
- **AWS Account boundary** ‚Äì governed by Org SCPs  
- **VPC boundary** ‚Äì isolates workloads and controls traffic  
- **IAM boundary** ‚Äì ensures least privilege separation of duties  
- **Service integration boundary** ‚Äì managed via EventBridge, Lambda, and Security Hub  

---

## Key Achievements & Impact
- **Proactive Risk Reduction:** Shifted security left via S3 Bucket Policies and Organizational SCPs, preventing violations at deployment.
- **Automated Incident Response:** Zero-touch remediation for compromised EC2 instances, reducing MTTR from hours to minutes.
- **Operational Efficiency:** Automated remediation of unencrypted objects and non-compliant instances, ensuring continuous compliance.
- **Enhanced Visibility:** Centralized compliance monitoring via AWS Security Hub, Config, and CloudWatch.
- **Framework Compliance Acceleration:** Directly mapped controls to NIST, PCI-DSS, HIPAA, and AWS Well-Architected Framework for streamlined audits.

## Threat Modeling Using STRIDE

### Spoofing
**Threats:**
- Simulated S3 events triggering bogus Lambda executions  
- Unauthorized AWS principals invoking Lambda or submitting false Security Hub findings  
- Spoofed EC2 metadata  

**Mitigations:**
- Lambda resource policies restricting invocation to trusted sources  
- Strict IAM trust policies  
- Region/account validation for Security Hub submissions  
- IMDSv2 enforced on EC2 for metadata integrity  

---

### Tampering
**Threats:**
- Overwriting legitimate S3 uploads  
- Insider manipulation of CloudWatch logs  
- Tampered EC2 system files/logs  

**Mitigations:**
- S3 Versioning enabled  
- Mandatory SSE-KMS encryption  
- S3 bucket policies denying uploads without `aws:kms` header  
- IAM denies on mutable actions for non-admins  
- Restricted CloudWatch access  
- Security Hub-driven automated isolation & termination  
- Auto Scaling replacement of terminated instances  

---

### Repudiation
**Threats:**
- Users denying unencrypted uploads or disputing remediation  
- Audit gaps reducing investigation effectiveness  
- Security team disputes over remediation actions  

**Mitigations:**
- CloudWatch Logs for full compliance event context  
- Immutable Security Hub records  
- S3 Access Logging enabled  
- Detailed structured logs for compliance & remediation actions  
- VPC Flow Logs for forensic retention  

---

### Information Disclosure
**Threats:**
- Sensitive logs exposing metadata/object paths  
- Unencrypted S3 objects  
- Overly permissive IAM roles  
- Compromised EC2 instances leaking sensitive data  

**Mitigations:**
- Data classification tags enforced with Config + SCPs  
- Mandatory encryption via bucket policies  
- Least privilege IAM enforcement  
- Strict KMS key policies + rotation  
- Immediate isolation of compromised instances  
- Minimal-permission IAM instance profiles  
- TLS cert rotation to prevent SSL/TLS bypass  

---

### Denial of Service
**Threats:**
- Excessive uploads overwhelming Lambda/API  
- Log/alert spam causing costs or alert fatigue  
- Mass EC2 compromise triggering cascading remediation  

**Mitigations:**
- Lambda timeouts configured  
- AWS SDK retries for API errors  
- S3 lifecycle rules for cost control  
- Circuit-breaker logic for remediation workflows  
- CloudWatch alarms for remediation rates  
- Auto Scaling with sufficient capacity  

---

### Elevation of Privilege
**Threats:**
- Over-permissive IAM roles for Lambda or EC2  
- IAM misconfigurations enabling lateral movement  

**Mitigations:**
- IAM roles scoped to least privilege  
- SCPs deny high-risk IAM actions (e.g., `iam:PassRole`)  
- Strict KMS key policies  
- Deny sensitive EC2/IAM actions in instance profiles  
- Auto-revocation of compromised credentials via termination  
- Config rules to detect overly permissive IAM
